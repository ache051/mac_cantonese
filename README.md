Cantonese input for Mac OSX

As a new Mac user, I found most of the Cantonese input methods for Mac OSX utilize ancient input standards such as Yale, which also requires users to input tonal variations in order to retrieve characters. I created this input plugin to assist folks who want to use something non-standard but easier to learn. The character lookup table of this input plugin is based on typical forum and chatroom English Cantonese.

To install:

1) Copy "mac_cantonese.inputplugin" to the Library > Input Methods folder.

2) Log off and log on.

3) Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources and add 粵拼 to the input methods.

4) Done! Enjoy!

[23.1.17] Addition:
If the input method doesn't appear after following the steps above, it could be related to privilege issues. In this case, please try the following:

1) Open a blank document with TextEdit
 
2) Go to Format > Make Plain Text
 
3) Open the downloaded mac_cantonese.inputplugin file with another instance of TextEdit
 
4) Copy everything over from mac_cantonese.inputplugin to the blank document

5) Save the new document with the name mac_canton.inputplugin

6) Close all TextEdit instances

7) Double-click on mac_canton.inputplugin

8) Check if the input method appears
