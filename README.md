Cantonese input for Mac OSX

As a new Mac user, I found most of the Cantonese input methods for Mac OSX utilize ancient input standards such as Yale, which also requires users to input tonal variations in order to retrieve characters. I created this input plugin to assist folks who want to use something non-standard but easier to learn. The character lookup table of this input plugin is based on typical forum and chatroom Enlgish Cantonese.

To install:

1) Copy "mac_cantonese.inputplugin" to the Library > Input Methods folder.
2) Log off and log on.
3) Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources and add 粵拼 to the input methods.
4) Done! Enjoy!
